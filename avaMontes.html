                <h3>Prologue</h3>
                <p>She sat in a nearly empty E train deep in the
                tunnels of New York City's subways waiting to reach Columbus
                circle station. She was still and calm, with a countenance of
                cold composure. Her round lips curled in a sneer of disgust as
                she watched the man across from her. A sloppy foul looking man
                concerned with little else but devouring the greasy chips in
                front of him. Pounding them into his mouth as he gorges on
                more before he can even finish his last bite. Breathing
                heavily from the exertion of like his life depended on it</p>

                <p>Oksana looked absolutely disgusted as he reached into
                the bag and grabbed the chips by the fistful, then wiping
                his hands on his already heavily greased stained pants. He
                looked up at her for a second and quietly looked away trying
                to avoid her stare. She saw shame in his eyes, but it wasn't
                shame at his public behavior, the look he gave her was the
                look one would give a beggar upon the streets.</p>

                <p>"Gluttonous pig, can't you even wait until you've
                finished swallowing before you stuff the next round into your
                mouth?"</p>
                
                <p>Oksana muttered to herself. In her disgust she stood up
                and started to walk to the other side of the train. Her long slender
                body glided across the floor as if she were more snake than human.
                Her long dark limp hair flowed as if a breeze passed right by her
                in the stillness of the train car. Oksana was no plain Jane by any
                means; some would say she was a model. Still one would think that
                such a striking creature like Oksana with her black macabre satin
                dress, five inch stilettos and milky white skin would command more
                attention than she was getting.</p>

                <p>Oksana stopped and stood in front of the doors as the train
                pulled into her station. She took a quick glance around, almost
                as if she were looking out for something or someone. The train doors
                opened but not just the ones we would expect to open, but the door
                that she stood in front of which faced the wall also and no one else
                seemed to notice. What appeared on the other side was a dark winding
                staircase that looked ancient beyond the years of the actual train
                system like something out of a medieval castle.</p>

                <p>Oksana quietly stepped into the quiet darkness and as the doors
                closed and the train moved on to its next destination only a blank
                wall remained where the door to nowhere had opened for Oksana Velour</p>
