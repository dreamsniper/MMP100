			<p>I was born in NYC and raised in the Bronx.<br>
				My teachers noticed a talent for me at an early age.<br>
				Art is something that has brought me focus and direction.<br>
				I attended <i>LaGuardia High School of Music and art</i> where i honed<br>
				my fine arts skills. I delved into oils paints and<br>
				acrylics, pottery and printmaking, but Illustration was always<br>
				my true love.
			</p>
			<p>I went on to study Graphic design at <i>Katherine Gibbs</i> where I earned<br>
				my degree in Visual Communications. I learned the use of many programs such as<br>
				<i>Photoshop</i> and <i>Illustrator</i> I gained a good understanding of the field<br>
				and went on to delve into another passion, Science.
			<p>
			<p>I currently hold a Full-Time position at <br><i>GIA<br>
				(The Gemological Institute of America)</i> the worlds foremost authority in<br> 
				Gems and Gemology. It was here that i was opened to different fields<br>
				of science and began my studies as a diamond grader.<br>
				I then decided that that was not enough so i enrolled into the BMCC<br>
				science program. After a few classes it became extremely apparent<br>
				that moving away from my creativity was not in my best interest and<br>
				that perhaps following this major might be a waste of time.<br>
			</P>
			<p>I was quickly convinced to go into programming by many of my video game<br>
				enthusiast buddies. But programming alone would not be enough for me.<br>
				It lacked the creativity i desired. Multimedia programming offered that<br>
				and more. So here i am in this class learning to do this in todays world.
